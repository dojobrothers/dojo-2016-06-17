Final thoughts
==============

(This document is being written three days after the dojo.  We should have written it at the end of it, together.)

Overall, everyone liked the experience and was satifisfied with the resulting code.  We decided that we should do more dojos.  
Daniel Saad would like to be our next sensei.
